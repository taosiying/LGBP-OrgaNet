> **LGBP-OrgaNet: Organoid Segmentation and Tracking via Learnable Gaussian Band-Pass Fusion and Bidirectional Cross-Scale Attention**  

This repository provides the official implementation of **LGBP-OrgaNet**, a hybrid CNN‚ÄìTransformer framework designed for **organoid segmentation and tracking**.  
Our method integrates CNN-derived local textures and Transformer-based global semantics through **Learnable Gaussian Band-Pass Fusion (LGBP-Fusion)** and enhances cross-scale information exchange via a **Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block (BCF)**.

The network is composed of:
- **Dual-branch Encoder** combining ResNet and Swin Transformer.  
- **LGBP-Fusion**: adaptive frequency-band decomposition and band-wise self-attention fusion.  
- **Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block (BCF)**: bidirectional self-attention and adaptive gating across scales.  
- **Progressive Decoder** with multi-scale concatenation and upsampling for robust segmentation and tracking.

</p>

  - Decomposes CNN and Transformer features into multiple **adaptive Gaussian frequency bands**.  
  - Performs band-wise self-attention fusion, effectively combining textures and semantics.  
  - Reduces cross-modal interference and improves interpretability.  

- **Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block (BCF)**
- <p align="center">

</p>
  - Employs **bidirectional self-attention** between high-resolution and low-resolution features.  
  - Adaptive gating balances fine-grained detail enhancement and semantic context refinement.  

- **Robustness across datasets**  
  - Validated on three organoid datasets (mice bladder, mammary epithelial, brain organoids).  
  - Outperforms UNet, TransUNet, OrganoID, and TransOrga.
